The `SpaMosaic` documentation style is inspired by `scSLAT`, a tool for single cell spatial alignment, 
and `SpatialGLUE`, a tool for spatial vertical integration.

Part of data used in our research also come from `SpatialGLUE`.  

Sincere gratitude is extended to Jinmiao and Koksiong for their meticulous guidance and 
invaluable contributions to this study.
