SpaMosaic documentation
===============================


``SpaMosaic`` aims to integrate mosaic datasets with partially overlapping modalities to construct higher dimensional views of tissues. ``SpaMosaic`` can handle multiple serial (or non-serial) sections from the same biological tissue or sections that form a time series such as embryo development. ``SpaMosaic`` works well on various spatial-omics technologies (spatial-atac-seq, spatial-cut&tag-seq, spatial-rna-epigenomics-seq, misar-seq, visium, stereo-seq and etc.).
